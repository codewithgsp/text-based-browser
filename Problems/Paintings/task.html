  <p>Alice has a collection of $n$ paintings, each having width equal to $w$ and height equal to $h$. Alice wants to decorate her house with the paintings. To do that, she decided to buy a square frame for all the paintings and hang them on the wall inside the frame.</p> 
  <p>In the store, there is a number of square frames available. The lengths of the frame sides are stored in a sorted list <code class="java">frames</code>. You need to find the frame with the minimum size inside which all the paintings can be hanged. The output of your code should be the index of that frame in the list <code class="java">frames</code>. </p> 
  <p>Note that the paintings can NOT be rotated. Also, two different paintings should not intersect.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input:</strong> three integer numbers separated by spaces: $n$ — the number of paintings, $w$ — the width of each painting, and $h$ — the height of each painting.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output:</strong> the index of the suitable frame with the minimum size. It is guaranteed that there is an appropriate frame in the list for all input cases.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-1065').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-1065" style="display:none;">
   You can look into the combined area of all paintings: which square covers this combined area?
